"""Week 02 starter — run the A/B experiment and record results.csv.

Usage: python run_ab.py [--runs 3]

Reads the task and the success criterion from TASK.md, runs each harness
--runs times, judges every run, appends one line per run to results.csv,
and saves each run's console output under logs/. Failed runs are kept:
they are data.
