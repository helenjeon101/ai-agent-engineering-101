"""Week 02 - the ReAct arm.

Fills in the run_react skeleton from the lecture. Every step the model gets the
whole history back and decides again what to do; a tool result comes back as an
Observation and the next Thought reacts to it.

Where the five axes are set, and how this differs from the Plan-then-Execute arm:

  1 context management   the FULL history accumulates. Every Thought, every
                         Action and every Observation is resent on every turn.
                         Nothing is summarised or dropped.
  2 tool granularity     tools_shared.TOOLS - identical to the other arm.
  3 termination          the model declining to call a tool (it answers in
                         prose) OR the max_steps ceiling, whichever comes first.
  4 error recovery       a tool exception is turned into an Observation and fed
                         back, so the model can fix its own argument and retry.
  5 human intervention   IRREVERSIBLE is empty: reading and counting cannot be
                         undone wrongly, so this arm runs fully autonomous.
                         Held identical to the other arm on purpose.

Run one arm on its own:
    py harness_react.py                 # real model, spends requests
    py harness_react.py --dry-run       # scripted model, spends nothing

# The value in the lecture skeleton and in weeks/week-02/starter. Runs 1-12

SYSTEM = """You are a log analyst working one step at a time.

You have two tools: read_file(path) and count_pattern(path, pattern).
count_pattern takes a Python regular expression and returns how many times it
matches in the file.

Work in small steps. Before each tool call, say in one sentence what you are
about to check and why. After you see the result, decide the next step from it.

When, and only when, you are certain of the answer, reply in prose with no tool
call. That reply is your final answer and it must contain the hour in HH:00
